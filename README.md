All Roboponics Source Code

This Repository contains the source code and CAD models for a group of automated hydroponics systems

RedCode is built to run on the arduino mega platform using a 20x4 LCD display. It can support up to 14 soil moisture sensors along with a temperature sensor, humidity sensor, 3 relays and a real time clock

GreenCode is built to run on the arduino nano platform using a 128x64 OLED display over the i2c interface. It can currently support up to 4 soil moisture sensors along with 2 relays and a real time clock.

Both RedCode and GreenCode are optimized to run an Ebb and flow hydroponics system and will be gaining support for more systems in the near future.
